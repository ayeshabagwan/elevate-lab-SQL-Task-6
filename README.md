# elevate-lab-SQL-Task-6

Task Objective:
To understand and implement subqueries in SQL using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses.



 What I Did Today:

- Studied what subqueries are and why they are used.
- Practiced writing **scalar subqueries** in the `SELECT` clause to calculate total orders per customer.
- Used subqueries inside `WHERE` clause with:
  - `IN` → to find customers who ordered a specific product.
  - `EXISTS` → to filter customers who have placed any order.
- Practiced **correlated subqueries** to match each row in the outer query with inner query logic.



 Key Concepts Practiced:
- Subquery vs Join (logical separation)
- Scalar Subquery (returns one value)
- Correlated Subquery (depends on outer query row)
- Subqueries in:
  - `SELECT` clause
  - `WHERE` clause (`IN`, `EXISTS`)
